Simulation of the chemical equilibrium w/ Matplotlib

This simulation is thought to illustrate the concepts of a chemical equilibrium
through a live plotting of the evolving equilibrium.

The simulation works by using a predefined equilirium and switching units from educts to products and products to educts
in the rate of the predefined equilibrium

  -> if you have a chemical equilibrium of 1 : 4 the result will be 4 parts of educt will be converted to products and 1 product to educts
  
The rate of the conversion can be influenced via the "anteil"-Parameter

This is a first Python-Project so efficiency isn't great but it works!
Have Fun
